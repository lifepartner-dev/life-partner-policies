        <p class="lead">Welcome to Life Partner App — a place to build genuine connections and discover your true partner in life.</p>
      </header>

      <hr />

      <section>
        <p class="intro">Life Partner App is more than just a dating app &mdash; it’s a place to find a <strong>serious and true life partner</strong>. In today’s internet world we can meet countless people across many social platforms, but it’s often hard to find someone genuine who is ready for a lifelong relationship. That’s why we built Life Partner App: to help people connect with those who want commitment and partnership. <strong>Your love story starts here, and you can find your life partner here</strong> with us.</p>

        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>Meeting someone face-to-face is not always easy in modern life. Many people are working or studying abroad, and even people from the same country can feel far apart when they live overseas. Life Partner App aims to bridge that distance so people can meet, connect, and begin their love stories regardless of location.</p>

        <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
        <p>To keep Life Partner App a safe, respectful, and positive community, please follow these principles:</p>

        <h3>1. Be Genuine</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create an honest profile with real photos and accurate information.</li>
          <li>Fake or misleading profiles and impersonation are not allowed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Show Respect</h3>
